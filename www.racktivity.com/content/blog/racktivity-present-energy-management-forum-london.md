Racktivity will be present at the 2nd **Energy Management Forum** , taking place in the America Square Conference Centre in London, on Tuesday, the 14th of May.

The Energy Management Forum is a must-attend event for businesses looking to reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency and boost margins.  [Click here to take a look at the agenda of the day.](http://www.sb-energy.net/7211)
The combination of rising energy costs and carbon legislation is pushing energy management further up the corporate agenda. In a recent white paper, Power Efficiency predicts staggering energy price rises of 81% by 2021. Additionally, the Climate Change Levy, Carbon Reduction Commitment and Renewables Obligation continue to put additional pressure on businesses.

Racktivity is looking forward to seeing you at the forum to discuss, explore and showcase the latest strategies and initiatives in energy consumption reduction.
