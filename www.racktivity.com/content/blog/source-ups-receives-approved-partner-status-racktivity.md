Uninterruptible power supply specialist Source UPS has been selected by multi award-winning power management solutions provider Racktivity to join its exclusive list of approved partners.

The Hampshire company will offer customers the Belgian manufacturer’s complete range of power distribution units (PDUs) and data centre monitoring software solutions.

Racktivity is a leader in remote power management innovation and offers one of the most reliable, intelligent and accurate PDUs on the UK market for smaller technical infrastructures such as telecom point of presence (PoPs) and data centres.

Their EnergySwitch PDU allows granular data capture taking 25,600 readings per port, per second which allows it to react very quickly to eliminate any down time with problem devices. It is also very efficient using 10% of the power of other PDUs.

Racktivity’s PDU offers data centres advanced metering and switching capabilities. The PDUs use a real-time operating system and enable businesses to make informed decisions on load balancing and managing IT assets based on power and energy consumption, all in one unit.

Racktivity also offers AC and DC din rail mountable units that will monitor all ‘out of rack’ devices such as cooling units, lighting, heating and more.

Attached to either the PDU, AC or DC monitor is an E²Sensor, an environmental sensor which captures up to three temperature points, humidity and motion detection. It also has up to eight additional input sensors as optional to cover fire, smoke, pressure, dry door, CCTV and more.

Racktivity’s Data Centre Performance Management (DCPM) software pulls all of the above information into an easy to use portal, allowing users to create customised reports to monitor multiple devices from a simple single pane of glass. The aim of the software is to increase reliability and uptime of data centre and telecom infrastructure while reducing operating expenses (OpEx) and carbon footprint. It can also take data from non- Racktivity devices and translate this data, via DCPM, into rich, actionable data.

Source UPS is delighted to partner with Racktivity after two of the power management supplier’s products won awards at the prestigious Data Centre Solutions (DCS) Awards 2013 in London back in May. The DCS Awards reward products, projects and services and honour companies and teams operating in the data centre field.

Racktivity’s DCPM won the ‘Data Centre Management Product of the Year’ category and its EnergySwitch PDU was runner-up for ‘Data Centre Energy & Efficiency Product of the Year’.

Source UPS Director Gavin Banks said: “Source UPS is proud to become an approved Racktivity partner. The company has quickly established itself in the data centre market and its products have already been recognised for their brilliance at the Data Centre Solutions Awards this year.
“Source UPS is very pleased to be able to now offer the Racktivity data centre products and solutions to our customers and are looking forward to working with Racktivity on several new data centre projects.”

Racktivity's UK Sales Manager Scott Roots said, “Racktivity are excited to partner with Source UPS as their knowledge of the data centre market and their clients’ needs is second to none.
They are the perfect partner to help us bring our solutions successfully to market. The Racktivity offering fits perfectly with what Source UPS are currently providing and ultimately will add great value to their clients. It also proves that Source UPS is at the cutting edge of technology.”
