As a telecom service provider you are concerned about uptime of the service you offer your customers and the operational cost it takes to run your service. Next to this, you are most likely challenged by corporate social responsibility guidelines to **reduce your carbon footprint and your total energy consumption** as well as to **rank high within international benchmarks with regards to green IT**. Racktivity provides the solutions to face and manage those challenges.

Compared to data centers, service providers have an additional challenge: remote facilities (PoP’s, interconnection Points, Mobile Tower Stations, Terrestrial Transmitter Station, HUBs, Head-Ends…) not only have AC powered appliances but also DC powered appliances.

The Racktivity solutions are composed of their own developed hardware and firmware to **measure, monitor and control both AC and DC power systems as well as environmental parameters**. \
Racktivity’s DCPM completes these solutions, allowing you to **measure, monitor and manage** your PoP's, Optical Nodes, HUB’s and many other **critical service locations in a centralised way**.

Alongside this, integration with third party equipment gives you full visibility on your power consumption, available capacity, temperature, potential alarms, CO footprint and indicate areas for potential savings and improvements.
