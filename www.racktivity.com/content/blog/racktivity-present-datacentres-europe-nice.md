Racktivity will be present at DataCentres Europe, taking place in the Acropolis in Nice, on Wednesday the 29th and Thursday the 30th of May.

DataCentres Europe is a global meeting place and forum for over 1000 users, operators and practitioners of IT infrastructure from more than 35 countries.
BroadGroup research forecasts that strong vertical market demand will drive growth in outsourcing to third party datacentres in Europe, and will equate to almost 30% of users by the beginning of 2016. But this linear perspective will largely disappear as the computing environment changes. IT departments emerge as cloud brokers, hosting applications across a range of datacentres and distributed architectures. Businesses will be offered a flexible menu of options, automated and on demand. For datacentres and users, this dénouement brings a completely new set of challenges and opportunities.
