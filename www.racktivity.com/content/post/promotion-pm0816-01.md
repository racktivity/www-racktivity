The Racktivity PowerManager PM0816-01 PDU gives you current, relevant and actionable power information to make intelligent decisions on load balancing and managing IT assets based on event triggers and energy consumption, to lower your total cost of ownership.

### The device is equipped with great benefits such as:

-   Real-time remote PDU- and outlet-level true RMS monitoring of current, voltage, power, power factor and energy consumption with only +/- 1% error margin.
-   Switchable outlet functionalities
-   Internal temperature reading
-   Console and webinterface access
-   Set SNMP traps
-   User-defined alarms and warning thresholds to help you protect against potential circuit overloads and environmental events.
