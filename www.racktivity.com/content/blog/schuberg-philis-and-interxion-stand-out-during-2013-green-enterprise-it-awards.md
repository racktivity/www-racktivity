One of our customers, **Schuberg Philis**, proudly announced it was selected as Finalist of the prestigious 2013 Green Enterprise IT (GEIT) Awards presented by Uptime Institute.
This global award showcases pioneering advancements that significantly improve energy productivity and resource use in IT.

Schuberg Philis and De Vlieg Techniek were awarded finalist, for their recent datacenter retrofit.
Among others, the operation involved the replacement of a 12-year old cooling installation within an existing live datacenter without any downtime for the IT-systems. The new cooling system is fueled mainly by thermal wells and produces, transports and uses cooling energy only when and where needed. The result of the combined measures is a 86% decrease in energy usage.

The winner in the category ‘Facility Retrofit’ is Interxion, also a customer of Racktivity, with their multiple facility seawater cooling implementation!
The awards judges – consisting of our industry peers – were impressed that they designed and implemented one of the first seawater cooling systems that not only [reduced energy costs](http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/06/21/case-study-recycling-data-center-seawater-amplifies-energy-savings) on the Stockholm campus by 80 percent, but also lowered our PUE from 1.6 to 1.09. The  judges also noted that this project is likely the only example of seawater cooling that also reuses heat in local community buildings in the world today, making it truly notable in today’s marketplace.
Interxion will present their case study at Symposium 2013.

A big thumbs up and congratulations to both companies!
