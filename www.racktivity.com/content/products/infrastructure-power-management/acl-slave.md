The **ACL Slave** Meter is an accurate power meter with 3 voltage inputs (+N) and 4 current clamp inputs connected to a RS485 Bus network. In addition the power meter has 4 dry inputs to connect any input like special circuit breakers (with dry contact outputs) or raid contact for the tap off boxes. Those contacts can generate SNMP traps that can be used for monitoring purposes.

The ACL Slave is also a compact DIN-Rail Power module that can have 4 mixed current clamps ranging from 25A up to 2000A.

Following information is measured on each port:

- tRMS voltage (V) on each voltage input (3)

- tRMS current (A)

- Apparent Power (VA)

- Real Power (W)

- Reactive Power (VAr)

- true Power Factor (tPF in %)

- Total Harmonic Distortion

- Resettable Energy (kWh, kVAh)

- Non-resettable Energy (kWh, kVAh)

- Harmonic information Voltage (up to 59th harmonic)



The ACL Slave provides you with the missing element for a complete power monitoring solution and solves any issues with large or distributed estates of AC powered equipment. With this addition Racktivity gives you the tools to measure and analyze your data in order to prevent downtime and reduce your carbon footprint in data center and your building.
