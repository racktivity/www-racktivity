The **ACL Master** will act as a gateway between Ethernet and up to 32 RS485 ACL Slave devices on one single IP address. It is compact DIN-Rail Gateway module with a 24V DC input for providing power to the ACL Slave devices or ACL Display via the RS485 Bus, an Ethernet connection, a compact OLED screen and 4 buttons for full configuration.

The **ACL Master** gathers all the measured data from its ACL Slave devices and sends them to the monitoring server or cloud. The ACL Master collects all log files from its connected ACL Slave meters on the on board SD card.

The **ACLMaster** module is fully compatible with Racktivity’s cloud based infrastructure WattsInsight and with DCPM, a Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System, allowing you to remotely monitor and manage power and critical environment metrics in your data centers, smaller distributed infrastructures and building.
