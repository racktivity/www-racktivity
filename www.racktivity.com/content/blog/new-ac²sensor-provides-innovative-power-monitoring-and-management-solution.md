Data Centre World, London, Stand K55,– February  25th, 2013: Racktivity, an innovator in next-generation energy and environment management solutions has launched its new AC2Sensor, a power monitoring solution to be installed at the AC power distribution board or in distributed remote locations such as PoPs, base stations, and Head Ends.

The 8 input AC sensor is fully compatible with the Racktivity DCPM software, a Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System, allowing organisations to remotely monitor and manage power and critical environment metrics across large data centres and smaller distributed infrastructures.

“Energy, power and environmental management within distributed infrastructures is sometimes considered as complex and expensive additions to PoP’s, cabinets or Head Ends for service providers and yet this part of the infrastructure forms the artery of today’s services.” explains Hans Witdouck, CEO for Racktivity “Tighter SLA’s and the pressure on carbon footprint reduction are increasingly forcing Service providers to consider how to meter and manage these critical elements. The AC2Sensor is a flexible device that offers power monitoring, metering, remote connectivity and supports environmental monitoring enabling visibility and control over your infrastructure. ”

The AC2Sensor can be installed at the AC power distribution board or in distributed remote locations such as PoPs, base stations, and Head Ends. The unit features a DIN rail mountable design, 1 or 3 phase systems and Ethernet connectivity with up to 8 inputs for current measurements. AC2Sensor features event driven logging and programmable thresholds for alarm notification to quickly alert administrators of local power and environmental issues.

The unit is fully compatible with Racktivity’s DCPM software, a Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System, the only distributed software solution to manage thousands of multi-vendor PDUs, sensors and 3rd party devices as a single environment. AC2Sensors also support the Racktivity E²Sensor range to offer environmental monitoring including temperature, humidity and motion sensing as well as smoke detection, water leak detection under raised floors and dry contact for rack door intrusion detection.

“AC2Sensor complements our existing DC2Sensor to provide a comprehensive power monitoring solution across data centres and distributed estates. In combination with our DCPM, we can provide a complete view of the power capacity usage by service providers and give them tools to analyse, simulate and reduce their carbon footprint.” Witdouck adds.

In line with the rest of the Racktivity range of products, the new AC2Sensor has a rich set of features that are accessed through either the built-in OLED display or via the DCPM platform for monitoring AC voltage per feed, current per input, power per port, total power, energy per port and total energy with extreme accuracy.
