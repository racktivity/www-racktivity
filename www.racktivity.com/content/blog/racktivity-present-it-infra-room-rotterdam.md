On the 12th of November, Racktivity will be present at IT Infra Room (De Kuip, Rotterdam, The Netherlands).

Energy efficiency, reliability, sufficient capacity, scalability.  A few important terms when building or remodeling computerspace/datacenter. 
A lot of choices have to be made, and in a lot of cases also a lot of compromises.  But which compromises?  
And are the targets set by management feasible?

The IT Room Infra event wants to offer visitors the correct and latest information to make the right decisions.  
The extended program exists of 26 lectures.  The speakers offer visitors a better and broader insight and talk about their expectations for the future.
A number of exhibitors are also present at the event, to give you an insight on the latest innovations in the market.

Come say hi to Racktivity at our **booth n° 34**.

We are looking forward to seeing you there!
