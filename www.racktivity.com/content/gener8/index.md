### IT Building Blocks

Gener8 are building blocks to instantly provide IT infrastructure capacity. Combining and stacking the building blocks provide you with scale-out capability for storage, compute and desktop capacity. Gener8 can also be used as stand-alone IT system in a hyperdense, silent and power-saving form factor.

### Gener8-PB

This building block generates 1.5 petabyte of storage in only 1 meter. This compares to capacity needed for 350,000 DVD movies, 500,000,000 high definition pictures and thousands of hours surveillance camera storage.

* Petabyte archive building block, no limits to scalability
* Power-friendly, comparable with energy for 2 toasters
* Self-healing and regenarating storage
* Simplified interfaces, standard fileserver
* Digital preservation is possible for 30+ years

#### Technical

* 1.5 PB
* NAS & SAN Interface
* 56 Gbit/sec ethernet
* 2.000 MB/sec ingest speed
* 1.000.000 IOPs (IO Operations Per Second)
* Height of building block is 140cm

### Gener8-HC

The hyperconverged building block has both storage and compute capacity for heavy production workloads. It can handle most applications available in the world. One generator is only 1 meter high and can run 500 virtual machines or 2500 workspaces.

#### Technical

* 1980 net usable GB memory
* 288 logical CPU cores
* 180 TB Ultra High Performance Embedded SAN Capacity
* 56 gbit/sec internal network backplane
* 1.000.000 IOPs (IO Operations Per Second)
* Height of building block is 140cm

### Gener8-HD

Standalone hyperdense IT system. Office form factor. Release in Q4 of 2015.
