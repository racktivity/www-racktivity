Comutel, part of the Telelink group, to bring next-generation energy and environment monitoring and management solutions to customers in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Ukraine and Hungary.

Racktivity and Comutel, a highly respected Serbia based system integrator, have announced a strategic agreement to help data center customers reduce costs and improve uptime through innovative energy management and monitoring software, smart power distribution and environmental sensor technology.

Comutel, part of the Telelink Group, has a 21-year history of excellence and is the leading Cisco Gold Partner in Serbia. The company has helped clients including leading regional telecom providers, public companies, government departments and major financial institutions in a wide range of data center projects.

“Our customers are keen to improve the efficiency of their data centers as the demand for IT services grows across the region.” explains Miodrag Radulovic, CEO for Comutel, “Racktivity provides a range of solutions that address critical energy and management concerns for a wide remit of organisations, both in our extensive internal testing process and in discussion with key customers it has become clear that there is a significant opportunity across the region by working closely with Racktivity.”

Comutel will offer the complete Racktivity portfolio including Racktivity’s Data Center Performance Manager (DCPM) suite, the only distributed software solution to manage up to thousands of smart PDUs and a wide range of other critical data center components – UPS, ATS/STS, airco, gensets, other smart PDUs brands, etc. – as a single environment. Racktivity’s EnergySwitch series of next-generation smart Power Distribution Units feature a real-time operating system delivering the highest degree of granular real-time power-quality type metrics. The range is complemented by the Racktivity EnergySensors offering a granular set of monitoring features including temperature, humidity and motion sensing as well as smoke detection, water leak detection and dry contact for rack door intrusion detection. Finally Comutel will also have access to the new Racktivity DC2Sensor for monitoring DC Power.

Aggregating AC power, DC power and all relevant environmental metrics through one single open platform (DCPM) for both concentrated data centers and thousands of smaller distributed remote locations such as PoPs, bay stations, optical nodes, head ends, etc.) Racktivity addresses real pain points and is a tangible solutions provider for national and international telecommunication and broadband service providers.
