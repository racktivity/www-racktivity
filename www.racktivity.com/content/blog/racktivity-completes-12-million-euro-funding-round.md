nnovative data center infrastructure management technology gains partner with proven track record in successfully growing ICT start-ups

Racktivity has successfully closed a €1.2 million round of funding with Big Bang Ventures. Belgium-based Racktivity provides efficient management and control systems for the data center infrastructure layer including power, temperature, air flow, rack access, humidity and network connectivity.

Although management of higher layers such as operating systems and applications have been used for many years, the physical infrastructure layer is often overlooked. The costs associated with this infrastructure represents 50% to 100% of server running cost over 3 years. Additionally, the financial impact of downtime is often much greater than actual server costs.

The combination of poor infrastructure management and unscheduled downtime means solutions, such as Racktivity that improve management capability over physical infrastructure, provide significant and quantifiable cost benefits.

Racktivity launched its first appliance earlier this year to allow data center operators to achieve improved uptimes, better power capacity planning and resilient protection for critical data center assets with faster disaster recovery abilities. The Data Center Management Unit, developed in the Racktivity labs in Gent – Belgium, measures all the physical parameters of the infrastructure layer and is remotely controlled via a single management portal and dashboard to provide real time infrastructure information and control across an entire data center.

The Data Center Measurement Unit can also take autonomous decisions in certain situations. For example, a power capacity problem will be instantaneously detected and the appliance will automatically decide which servers need to powered on or off based on policies defined by the data center administrators. The Data Center Management Unit also has an open API to allow users to write plug-ins to add more functions or integrate with other tools.

Racktivity was in founded in 2008 by Wilbert Ingels, CEO, following extensive experience in the data center industry with senior management roles at Level 3 and Terremark. Gent based IT innovator and serial entrepreneur Kristof De Spiegeleer is the primary investor in Racktivity.

Commenting on the new funding round, Kristof De Spiegeleer said, “I am delighted that I can again work with Big Bang Ventures as they contribute a lot through their understanding of the market and experience in helping start-up organizations successfully expand.”

De Spiegeleer has a proven track record in developing and bringing innovative technologies to commercial successes including Datacenter Technologies (acquired by Symantec), Hostbasket (acquired by Telenet), Dedigate (acquired by Terremark) and Q-Layer (acquired by SUN Microsystems).

Frank Maene, Managing Partner of Big Bang Ventures added, “We have worked several times with Kristof over the years and I consider him to be one of the most driven and successful entrepreneurs that I know. “

Maene believes that Racktivity has a truly innovative product that meets a critical requirement for the data center industry at a time when the sector shows strong growth potential due to the rise of visualization and cloud computing. “We took the first prototypes with us to prospective customers to gauge their reaction and returned with order requests. For a product at such an early stage—it was a truly fantastic achievement and we knew we had something special on our hands.” Maene adds.
