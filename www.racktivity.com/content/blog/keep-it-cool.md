The life span of electronics - including power supplies - and their "Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF*)" depends on the quality of the components and the average temperature of the components.

The MTBF of a component decreases when temperature produced by the component increases. 
So there is a direct and causal correlation between heat produced by data center components (PDUs, servers, etc.) and these data center components failing.

The warmer they get, the sooner they will fail or to put it the other way around: the cooler they remain the longer they will last.

Key in every design should be to achieve the lowest possible operating temperature including avoidance of any hotspots. Additionally the components have to be carefully selected to achieve the optimal MTBF.

When looking at smart Power Distribution Units (PDU*), industry standards on power consumption most often are around 40W, occasionally some vendors reach 25W-30W.

#### traditional industry standards
--------------------------------------

One of the industry leading smart PDU vendors, hereafter referred to as ‘A’, brings intelligent PDUs to the market that consume 25W-30W. Their power supplies and their capacitors have an average temperature inside the case of 55-65°C at an ambient temperature of 25°C (in the data room or data center). These are generic capacitors.

Following fundamental issues occur in the A design:

1. Temperature and power consumption are too high.

2. Capacitors do not have the right specs, A uses Lelon RXF capacitors which have specifications that are not in line with the use case. Lelon RFX have a MTBF of 5.000 hours at 105°C. In the A use a minimum of 12.000 hours at 105°C is required.

#### racktivity smart pdus - don’t compromise
-------------------------------------------------

Racktivity intelligent EnergySwitch PDUs consume 4W only and the internal Racktivity EnergySwitch PDUs temperature is 30°C to 35°C at an ambient temperature of 25°C. 

The Racktivity EnergySwitch power supply has following specifications:

1. Maximum load: 15W
2. At an ambient temperature of 25°C the power supply has an MTBF of 346.898 Hours (almost 40 years) at full load (15W)
3. Racktivity doesn't use the power supply at full load (only 4W) resulting in an even higher MTBF than specified above.

This means that Racktivity EnergySwitch PDUs will last longer than any other smart PDU to be found in the industry. In fact they will outlive your own professional career.

#### conclusion
----------------------------------------------

You are planning on purchasing "smart" PDUs? Most probably your key criteria are or should be:

1.  What do they cost (capex)
2.  What do they consume (opex)
3. What do they offer in operational benefits (increased reliability, user friendliness, etc.)
4. How long will they last


Racktivity is your best choice for all these criteria.

The "Smart" in PDU: PDUs featuring 'intelligent' specs, this may vary a lot from vendor to vendor: remote access, management features, inlet metered vs. outlet metered, switched, ....
The Smart in Racktivity PDUs: All conceivable power metrics at single outlet level. No OS. Operational in less than 3 seconds. Oscilloscope view (detection micro interruptions). Harmonics (prediction of failing power supplies). No spark risk whilst toggling on/off. Electronic Fast Fuse Protection (EFFP) for increased Disaster Prevention. Ultra low power consumption. No Single Point of Failure (SPOF).
