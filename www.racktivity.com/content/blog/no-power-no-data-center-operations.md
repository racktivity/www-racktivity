The cost of downtime for Facebook July 31st 1 h= (1) per min loss $ 20k, (2) negative customer experience, negative publicity (3) potentially negative impact on share value. The reason for this downtime wasn't mentioned. 

Often downs are due to power failures; this layer in data centers is still not always managed the way it could be. The physical layer (power and environmentals) is the least one invested in, the least under control and at the same time the most important one. Talking about a paradox. No power, no data center operations.
