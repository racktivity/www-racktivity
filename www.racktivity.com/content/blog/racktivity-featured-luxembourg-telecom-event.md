Luxembourg Telecom invited Racktivity, a cleantech innovator in next generation energy management technology, to host a session on how to save power by up to 50% and significantly increase uptime in data centers.

Racktivity launched its next-generation power management devices in early 2010 and received strong customer interest as well as adoption by cleantech leaders such as Terremark Europe, Luxembourg Telecom, Combell, Zenith Infotech Ltd and many others.

“The data center industry is growing rapidly across the world and we believe that the industry is ready for innovation to solve one of the main challenges stemming from high energy consumption that impacts fundamental economics of building, operating and expanding data centers,” explains Nicolas Hecq, Sales Director Europe Racktivity.

Racktivity was founded in 2008 by an experienced team of entrepreneurs with proven track record and deep expertise in cloud computing, virtualization and data center technologies. Ghent-based IT innovator and serial entrepreneur Kristof De Spiegeleer is the Chairman of Racktivity and was the seed investor while founder and serving CTO Wilbert Ingels was most recently the COO of Terremark Europe. The founding team has a proven track record of developing and bringing innovative technologies to commercial success, such as Datacenter Technologies (acquired by Symantec), Hostbasket (acquired by Telenet), Dedigate (acquired by Terremark) and Q-Layer (acquired by SUN Microsystems). Racktivity received its first round of investment from Big Bang Ventures, a leading early-stage venture fund based in Belgium.

The Racktivity Data Center Management Platform™ monitors and manages detailed energy profiles of data center assets. Its unique Rack Controller™ device replaces conventional power distribution units in each rack in the data center and accurately and granularly monitors energy consumption, temperature, humidity, airflow and rack security.

At this event a delegate of the Racktivity Management team along with Nicolas Hecq shared their vision on energy management in data centers. Racktivity will showcased the latest release of the Rack Controller.
