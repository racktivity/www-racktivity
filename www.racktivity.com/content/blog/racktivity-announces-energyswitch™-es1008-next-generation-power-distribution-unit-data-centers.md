…enables market’s most advanced real-time metering, switching and analysis capabilities…

Racktivity announces the availability of its new next generation EnergySwitch™ ES1008 Power Distribution Unit (PDU) solution for energy and environmental management within data centers. Racktivity’s ES1008 gives data center professionals real-time, true RMS measurement capability, predictive analysis and individual power-port level switching capability, all at the industry’s lowest energy consumption available in a PDU device.

“Our new ES1008 PDU is the most intelligent PDU available in the market today, providing those real-time metrics essential for operators to precisely understand and manage their power consumption in data centers,” said Marco DeMiroz, President & CEO of Racktivity. “The ES1008 provides the most comprehensive set of performance analytics for every port along with per-port switching. Our ES1008 actually sees voltage spikes, ripple and sag, along with harmonics produced by attached IT devices before they actually fail. Our EnergySwitch Family is the first Genius PDU on the market.”

One existing customer, Philippe Durando, CTO of Luxembourg Telecom, provides some insight into his selection of Racktivity PDU devices; “We needed a PDU solution to give us highly detailed per-port energy monitoring in our data centers and found the True RMS monitoring and remote management features on the Racktivity ES1008 to be much more comprehensive than anything else we had evaluated. As a result, we have found energy management and control much easier with less guesswork. Based on these stellar results, we expect to be deploying the Racktivity EnergySwitch PDU solution across more and more of our operations.”

Racktivity EnergySwitch PDUs give data center professionals actionable power utilization data to make informed decisions on power consumption and power quality. EnergySwitch PDUs provide real-time remote switching and port-level true RMS monitoring of current (amps), voltage, power (kVA, kW), power factor and energy consumption (kWh, kVAh) with better than 99% accuracy. They also integrate with Racktivity’s EnergySensor™ family of data center environmental sensors for enhanced monitoring of temperature, humidity, motion, light, sound, leaks, smoke, air pressure and air flow. User-defined alarm and warning thresholds help manage risk with real-time local and remote alerts to warn of potential circuit overloads and environmental events.
