DCPM, Racktivity's award winning power monitoring software is now released in a new version, version 1.4.

For performance and security reasons our software is preferred to be installed on a separate application server and database server. In the updated manual you will find the procedure to create and configure your external database.  Download your manual on the following link.

Users who like to install DCPM's evaluation can connect up to two devices for FREE. The Evaluation version can be installed on a single server and has no restrictions compared to the licensed version.

For users who like to use DCPM in a production environment (more than two devices) a separate DB server needs to be installed.
