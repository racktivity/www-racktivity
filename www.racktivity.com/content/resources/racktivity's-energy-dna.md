EnergyDNA™ is the patent-pending set of technologies developed by Racktivity in direct response to the industry’s desire to better understand power within the data center. EnergyDNA is the core of the Data Center Performance Management system. In essence, it enables extremely detailed measurements to be collected, compared and visualized in real-time.

EnergySwitch™ Family
--------------------

In our EnergySwitch family of PDU devices, EnergyDNA takes the form of advanced Digital Signal Processors (DSP) which sample power at the per-outlet level then being interpreted by our own Fast-Fourier transformations. EnergyDNA provides the math associated with calculating True RMS Power, kVAh, Power Factor, Hertz and everything else which can be derived by looking at high granular samples of data. In fact EnergyDNA technology allows the sampling of each outlet more than 30,000 times a second to create a mathematical representation of the power signal itself. In doing so, Racktivity has the ability to analyze power at the power level in the same vain as the much more traditional, high cost Power Quality instrumentation found in a few key places within an enterprise. Reducing the cost of Power Quality analytics is one of the keys to EnergyDNA.

EnergyDNA is delivered in our hardware appliances as part of the EnergyOS™ firmware itself. As new key performance indications are agreed upon across the industry, Racktivity can simply add new transformations to our existing firmware which drives our embedded DSP processors. EnergyDNA is the modern approach to power observation and provides more than a dozen types of detailed metrics information.

DCPM (service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System, EnergyDNA takes the form of highly granular physical and logical partitioning allowing for any combination of these to be used to interactively filter metric results. All devices have a number of attributes associated with their roles. Some of these attributes are physical in nature, and are defined by the devices actual placement in a data center. For example, an outlet is part of a PDU, the PDU is part of a rack, the rack is part of a row, the row is part of a pod, and so forth. In addition, each outlet will be assigned a number of business attributes, anything from organizational data, to management ownerships, projects or IT function. Any number of these attributes can be assigned to each port across the enterprise.

DCPM then uses our EnergyDNA technologies to allow highly discriminating drill-down access to this information. Any combination of these physical and logical attributes can be applied and the results seen in real-time, or trended over some period of time.

EnergyDNA makes highly granular real-time access to data possible.
