### _In the past we were facing recurring problems with intelligent PDUs from another brand. In our industry, uptime and customer satisfaction being essential success criteria, we decided to screen the market for reliable PDUs. We found them at Racktivity, a belgian company with global footprint and most of all a deep power knowledge. As an example, Racktivity PDUs are standard equipped with bistable relays. This not only dramatically lowers the PDU's power consumption, when a Racktivity PDU power supply would fail, servers that are being powered trough Racktivity PDUs would still get powered. That's disaster prevention well thought._ ###

### _Several features of Racktivity intelligent EnergySwitch PDUs translate in relevant operational benefits and couldn’t be found elsewhere. Harmonics, oscilloscope view, the electronic fast fuse protection, immediate start up - just to name some examples - convinced us of the fact that Racktivity has a distinctive vision on what value add in power management means and also that it has the ability to execute this vision in best-of-breed products._ ###
