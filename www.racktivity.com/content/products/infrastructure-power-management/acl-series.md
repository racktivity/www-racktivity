Racktivity presents a brand new solution to remotely monitor and manage AC power within the tap off boxes of the busbar system or electrical cabinets. The solution uses a RS485 bus connection (via RJ45 cable) between the different meter units that will be installed in the tap off boxes or electrical cabinets. 

Following items are available in this product range:

[ACL Master](/products/infrastructure-power-management/acl-master "ACL Master")

[ACL Slave](/products/infrastructure-power-management/acl-slave "ACL Slave")

[ACL Display](/products/infrastructure-power-management/acld-display "ACLD")



As metering device Racktivity is using ACL Slave Meter in combination whith the ACL Master Meter. This combination provides the user whith the following specifications:

The ACL Slave Meters are connected in a bus structure over RS485. The ACL Master will act as gateway towards Ethernet. Every ACL Master can handle 32 ACL Slave Meters.

4 current transformers can be connected to each ACL Slave

3 channel voltage input (3x single voltage measurement or 3 phase voltage measurement) on ACL Slave meters.

Redundant power supply of the ACL Slave (through the RS485 bus and on the 1^st^ power phase of the ACL Slave Meter) so even when the circuit breaker in the cabinet tripped or no AC power is available in the tap off box, information and power data remains available and accessible

Only 1 IP address per 32 slave devices is needed.

The ACL Slave has 4 x IO ports available for use with breaker switch enabling breaker alarms with SMNP traps

Web based user interface (ACL Master), SNMP monitoring (ACL Master) and open API (ACL Master) for integration in third party applications or easy integration in the Racktivity software.

ACL Slave Meters are dual powered

-   Via their own RS485 bus
-   Via the voltage input on the device

Benefits
