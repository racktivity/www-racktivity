When running a data center, your biggest concerns are uptime and energy consumption. Racktivity has the solutions to help you manage these daily challenges.

In order to **maximize your uptime**, Racktivity devices are equipped with unique features such as electronic fast fuse and inrush current protected relays to prevent complete racks to go down in case of a short circuit. The devices will also provide you with back-up access to your servers in case you lose your prime management connection.

Knowing what devices are consuming most of the energy and finding out where you can **save on energy**, has a direct impact on your bottom line and **your carbon footprint**.

With the right tools, you can identify the worst performing servers and appliances and find out where temperature is too low, enabling you to reduce your power consumption and to get a firm grip on your electricity bill. \
Next to reducing your power consumption, itâ€™s equally important to be able to provide your customers with **correct billing information**. Accuracy is a key value here.

Thanks to our DCPM - Our Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System - you get **full visibility**across connected local and remote infrastructures, down to server-level.\
Depending on your specific needs, our platform can provide **detailed analyses** such as carbon footprint, power capacity management, PUE, power consumption of each individual server, aggregated data across multiple servers/appliances and even complete data centers.
