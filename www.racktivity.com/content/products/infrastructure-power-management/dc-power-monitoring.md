To give a total overview of your power consumption, Racktivity has complemented its product line with a new family of power meter and monitoring devices.
The DC²Meter addresses the needs of telecommunications, broadband, wireless and broadcast service providers. The meter can be installed at the DC power distribution board or in distributed remote locations such as PoPs, base stations, and head ends. The unit features a DIN rail mountable design and Ethernet connectivity and features 12 inputs for current measurements.

The DC²Meter also supports our [E²Sensor](/products/environmental-management/E2Sensor) range to offer a granular set of environmental monitoring including temperature, humidity and motion sensing as well as smoke detection, water leak detection under raised floors and dry contacts for rack door intrusion detection.

The meter is fully compatible with our [DCPM, a Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System](/products/power-management-software/dcpm), allowing you to remotely monitor and manage power and critical environment metrics in your data centers and/or smaller distributed infrastructures.

The DC²Meter provides you with the missing element for a complete power monitoring solution and solves any issues with large or distributed estates of DC powered equipment.
With this addition, Racktivity gives you the tools to measure and analyse your data in order to prevent downtime and reduce your carbon footprint.
