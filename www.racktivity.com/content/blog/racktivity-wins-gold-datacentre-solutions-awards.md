We are extremely proud to announce you that Racktivity has won 2 awards at the prestigious Datacentre Solutions Awards 2013 held in London.

The Datacentre Solutions Awards reward the products, projects and services as well as honour companies and teams operating in datacentre fields. The DCS Awards recognise the achievements of end-users, channel partners and vendors alike. Winners were selected by public vote.

Racktivity’s Data Center Performance Management (DCPM) won the Gold Medal in the prestigious ‘Datacentre Management Product of the Year’ category. DCPM beat products from SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC, NLYTE SOFTWARE, EMULEX, APTARE, IPsoft, Sentinel Navigator CSP, yandree GmbH, Abiquo, iTAnalyzer, , Ipswitch Network Management Division Debriefing Software and NDSL Group Ltd.

DCPM is the ultimate software to monitor, visualize, control and automate power and environmental parameters with the goal to increase the reliability and uptime of data center and telecom infrastructure while at the same time reducing opex and carbon footprint. The platform offers a global view allowing full drill down to the individual power outlet or sensor and everything in between. DCPM manages entire telecommunication infrastructures, data centers, campuses, builds, pods, rows, racks or any other type of physical infrastructure design.

Franziska Priebe, Marketing Manager of award organisers Angel Business Communications, says “This year we have had not only a significant increase in the overall number of nominations but also in the total votes received. The DCS Awards recognise the users, manufacturers and suppliers operating in the datacentre fields and are voted for by the readers of our wide range of print and online publications. All finalists did well in making the shortlist but Racktivity was the clear winner in its category ‘Datacentre Management Product of the Year’ and runner-up in the category ‘Datacentre Energy Efficiency Product of the Year.”

Racktivity EnergySwitch PDU also won a Silver award for Datacenter Energy Efficiency Product of the Year.

“Winning these awards against such stiff competition is a great honour for us,” says Hans Witdouck, CEO for Racktivity, “We would like to thank the judges for looking at our products in terms of merit and innovation and our customers who allowed us to reference their successful installations in our entries and voted for us in the awards.”
