To give a total overview of your power consumption, Racktivity has complemented its product line with a new family of power meter and monitoring devices.

Our [DC²Meter](/products/infrastructure-power-management/dc-power-monitoring) and [AC²Meter](/products/infrastructure-power-management/ac-power-monitoring-ac2meter) can be installed at the (AC and/or DC) power distribution board or in distributed remote locations such as PoPs, base stations, and head ends.

Our latest products in the family are the AC power monitoring link series (ACL). The [ACL series](/products/infrastructure-power-management/acl-series) are typically used to monitor and meter AC power busbar systems or electrical cabinets.

All units feature a DIN rail mountable design, Ethernet connectivity and supports multiple inputs for current measurements. They also support our E²Sensor range to offer a granular set of environmental monitoring including temperature, humidity and motion sensing as well as smoke detection, water leak detection under raised floors and dry contacts for rack door intrusion detection.

The meters are fully compatible with our [DCPM, a Service Provider Infrastructure & Data Center Performance Management System,](/products/power-management-software/dcpm) allowing you to remotely monitor and manage power and critical environment metrics in your data centers and/or smaller distributed infrastructures.

The meters provide you with the missing element for a complete power monitoring solution, and solves your issues with large or distributed estates of AC and/or DC powered equipment.

With this addition, Racktivity can now provide you a complete view of the power capacity usage and gives you the tools to analyze, simulate and reduce your carbon footprint.
