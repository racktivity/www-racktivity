+++

One of the major challenges of todayâ€™s companies is the need to achieve close to 100% uptime.
As downtime can result in a hit on credibility, lost revenues, lowered stock value and/or lost customers, one of your major priorities is uptime.

In order to truly drive data centre performance with maximized availability and energy efficiency, you require detailed insights and control of the various electrical power metrics.

That is why the Racktivity EnergySwitch PDUs are equipped with unique features such as Electronic Fast Fuse Protection (EFFP), zero crossing switching and inrush current protected relays.

### Electronic Fast Fuse Protection (EFFP)

This unique feature offers your company an additional security. 
A short circuit in a server up to 200A can result in one or several racks going down. Thanks to the Electronic Fast Fuse Protection (EFFP), the EnergySwitch PDU isolates the server causing the problem. This results in only one server going down instead of a full rack (or even more). 
An important additional gain is that instead of starting up a full rack or multiple racks again without knowing the cause of the downtime (with the risk everything goes down again), the faulty server is immediately identified, allowing an easy and swift disaster recovery process.

### Oscilloscope view

Thanks to its oscilloscope view, the EnergySwitch PDUs show the exact wave shape of current and voltage. This can only happen due to the very accurate measurements of Racktivity's EnergySwitch PDUs.
With this level of accuracy and detail, you can detect micro interruptions, phase shifting and other anomalies, enhancing your visibility on power quality.

### Harmonics

The EnergySwitch PDUs give you visibility on the harmonics of the electrical signals and this up to 59th harmonics, allowing you to detect degenerating power supplies,power supplies with poor characteristics.

### Zero crossing switching

In alternating current (AC), the zero-crossing is the instantaneous point at which there is no voltage present. When electrical power is switched, the EnergySwitch PDU outlets will only switch at an instant when there is no current (zero-crossing) so no electrical interference is generated.
Thereby, Racktivity EnergySwitch PDUs litigate risk of sparks and prevent relays to start sticking. Both aspects are disaster prevention features and will heavily impact the MTBF, causing the PDUs to have a longer lifespan than other PDUs.

### Control of inrush current

The outlets of the EnergySwitch PDUs switch on one after the other, dividing the inrush current over a certain time lapse to prevent servers going down due to an overload of power.
Managers can define themselves how long the delay of start-up is.
This control of inrush current offers a protection against starting racks to drop.

### Console access

The [horizontal Racktivity PDUs (our 1U PDUs)](/products/rack-power-management/es1108-16-us-us/) feature both console access and smart PDU functionalities, all in one, providing you with back-up access to the servers in case you lose your primary management connection.
