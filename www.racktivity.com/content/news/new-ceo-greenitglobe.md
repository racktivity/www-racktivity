February 15, 2016, GHENT, BELGIUM --- Green IT Globe NV, a fast growing technology company is about to radically change the industry by building a decentralized and energy-efficient cloud. Green IT Globe will deploy its revolutionary cloud network in more than 20 countries, bringing cloud capacity close to the user rather than sourcing it from large, often overseas, datacenters.

The founder of Green IT Globe, Kristof De Spiegeleer, has done an exceptional job by delivering his disruptive technology vision. “I am happy that my co-founder Willem Hendrickx is taking a full operational role.”

Co-founder Willem Hendrickx joins Green IT Globe from Alcatel-Lucent, where he was President EMEA and responsible for all sales and operational activities in the region. He previously held several executive positions with distinguished global IT companies. Kristof De Spiegeleer is delighted: “Since 2000 we have been innovating the datacenter world. Now we are about to radically change the way clouds are deployed. The time is right to establish a European cloud but in a decentralized, efficient way: creating a grid”

Willem Hendrickx: “It’s every man’s dream to make a difference in the world and I’m lucky to have met a visionary whose ambition it is to build a company that can provide equal opportunities for all mankind. We have brought together the technology, the team and the financial back-up to do so. Green IT Globe is bringing the cloud close to the users, increasing the performance and privacy at an unseen lower cost which will also allow access for emerging regions. The software is 100% European and is guaranteed to have no backdoors or privacy issues. Privacy will no longer be in the hands of a handful of corporate giants.”

Green IT Globe will be present at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (22-25 Feb) to meet up with the world’s industry leaders.
