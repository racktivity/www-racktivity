    "content": "One of the major data centre challenges today is the increasing cost of electricity Over the past decade the cost of electricity has increased significantly and this trend is not expected to fade away soon Industry data and studies mention power costs can account for over 50 of the total data centre operational cost In addition to controlling operational expenses the need to achieve close to 100 uptime is shifting from a service to a pure necessity one may even say a commodity For companies downtime can translate in a hit on credibility lost revenues lowered stock value andor lost customers So companies are faced with the challenge to ensure a maximum of uptime and service whilst keeping energy cost under control To overcome these challenges they have in general three choices expand power and cooling capacity build new data centres deploy a power management solution that analyses maximizes and improves the usage of existing capacity As the first two options require major investments and other resources they should invest in the third According to the Uptime Institutes survey results regarding data centre business priorities for 2013httpuptimeinstitutecomimagesstoriesNANetworkTop10DCBusinessMgtPrioritesUINTop10MgmtPrioritiesfor2013pdf 52 of the data centre owners cite the need to improve metrics for powerusage effectiveness and uninterruptible power supply as well as those related to network and rack operations 32 of all participants said capacity planning for critical resources such as power and rack space are increasingly of strategic important In order to truly drive performance with maximized availability and energy efficiency the management team requires detailed insights and control of the various electrical power metrics equip your business with the industrys most advanced metering and switching capability Racktivity EnergySwitch smart are built upon Racktivitys realtime operating system EnergyOS to provide the highest degree of granular realtime PowerQuality type metrics EnergyOS implements the hardwarerelated portions of Racktivitys EnergyDNA technology to provide realtime remote PDUlevel and outletlevel true RMS monitoring of current A voltage V power VA W power factor and energy consumption kWh with 99 accuracy Reduce OPEX Knowing what devices are consuming most of the energy detecting idle underutilized or power ineffective servers and finding out where they can save on energy has a direct impact on the bottom line and carbon footprint of any company With the IT equipment the most significant savings are normally found in what is the biggest source of waste in most data centres poor server utilization By linking the EnergySwitch PDU data with or a third party management software solution you can see what the correlation of the server power load with cpumemory load of the applications thereon is Based on this correlation the system indicates which servers are underutilized or maybe even idle It furthermore informs the user what applications can be moved safely in terms of power and cpumemory load and at the same time it indicates the yearly saving when doing so thus offer a prescriptive analysis tool telling users what to do in order to improve power efficiency without increasing the risk for downtime Successful consolidation initiatives can reclaim a considerable amount of rack space and stranded power But the also pull their weight to help the carbon footprint go down Thanks to the use of bistable relays energy efficient power supply and 80Mhz chip vs 500 Mhz up to 1000 Mhz as industry standard the PDUs feature an ultra low power consumption Thanks to inhouse developed firmware installed on the PDUs no additional operating system is required therefor significantly reducing startup time are operational in less than 3 seconds Maximize uptime As downtime can result in a hit on credibility lost revenues lowered stock value andor lost customers one of the data centers major priorities is uptime In order to maximize uptime Racktivity are equipped with unique features such as Electronic Fast Fuse Protection EFFP zero crossing switching and inrush current protected relays Zero crossing switching In alternating current AC the zerocrossing is the instantaneous point at which there is no voltage present When electrical power is switched the outlets will only switch at an instant when there is no current zerocrossing so no electrical interference is generated Thereby Racktivity litigate risk of sparks and prevent relays to start sticking Both aspects are disaster prevention features and will heavily impact the MTBF causing the PDUs to have a longer lifespan than other PDUs Control of inrush current The outlets of the switch on one after the other dividing the inrush current over a certain time lapse to prevent servers going down due to an overload of power Managers can define themselves how long the delay of startup is This control of inrush current offers a protection against starting racks to drop Electronic Fast Fuse Protection EFFP This unique feature offers data centers an additional security A nearshort circuit in server up to 200A can result in one or several racks going down Thanks to the Electronic Fast Fuse Protection EFFP the isolates the responsible server This results in only one server going down instead of a full rack or even more An important additional gain is that instead of starting up a full rack or multiple racks again without knowing the cause of the downtime with the risk everything goes down again the faulty server is immediately identified allowing an easy and swift disaster recovery The devices also provide the data centers with backup access to the servers in case they lose their prime management connection Increase customer loyalty The numbers tell the tale The better and more detailed you measure the better you are informed and consequently take the most appropriate decisions measure 25000 samples per second per individual outlet V and A Having the capability to measure power usage and power quality this accurately from source down to the mouth individual power outlet or sensor and everything in between giving you the right tools at hand to make informed decisions Plan capacity Enterprises rely on data centres to meet their continuous growth objectives therefor rigorous and wellthought capacity planning and management is critical to each data centre allowing them to accommodate both the expected and unexpected needs of their customers business Thanks to the right and accurate metrics provided by the they can manage capacity planning for both contingencies and planned growth bringing significant cost and space saving Case Study

expected to fade away soon Industry data and studies mention power costs can account for over 50 of the total data centre operational cost In addition to controlling operational expenses the need to achieve close to 100 uptime is shifting from a service to a pure necessity one may even say a commodity For companies downtime can translate in a hit on credibility lost revenues lowered stock value andor lost customers One of the major challenges of companies today is the increasing cost of electricity Over the past decade the cost of electricity has increased significantly and this trend is not expected to fade away soon Industry data and studies mention power costs can account for over 50 of the total data centre operational cost In addition to controlling operational expenses the need to achieve close to 100 uptime is shifting from a service to a pure necessity one may even say a commodity For companies downtime can translate in a hit on credibility lost revenues lowered stock value andor lost customers So enterprises are faced with the challenge to ensure a maximum of uptime and service whilst keeping energy cost under control To overcome these challenges data centres have in general three choices 1 Expand power and cooling capacity 2 Build new data centres 3 Deploy a power management solution that analyses maximizes and improves the usage of existing capacity As the first two options require major investments and other resources data centres should invest in the third According to the Uptime Institutes survey results regarding data centre business priorities for 2013 52 of the data centre owners cite the need to improve metrics for powerusage effectiveness and uninterruptible power supply as well as those related to network and rack operations 32 of all participants said capacity planning for critical resources such as power cooling and rack space are increasingly of strategic important In order to truly drive performance with maximized availability and energy efficiency the management team requires detailed insights and control of the various electrical power and environmental metrics both on IT level and on facility level Racktivitys DCPM Our Service Provider Infrastructure Data Center Performance Management System productspowermanagementsoftware is a missioncritical management software designed to address the specific power both on IT and facility level and environmental aspects of the companys infrastructure By providing you with the most accurate and detailed metrics you are able to maximize uptime productivity availability and efficiency all through the DCPM software suite Reduce OPEX Knowing what devices are consuming most of the energy detecting idle underutilized or power ineffective servers and finding out where you can save on energy has a direct impact on the bottom line and carbon footprint With the IT equipment the most significant savings are normally found in what is the biggest source of waste poor server utilization The provides you with the right information to correlate between the power usage for a specific server and the CPU memory usage of that same server helping you identify the worst performing servers and appliances It delivers the tools to redistribute the applications over fewer servers with as a consequence better utilization of resources Successful consolidation initiatives can reclaim a considerable amount of rack space and stranded power Depending on the specific needs of the data centre The can provide detailed analyses such as carbon footprint power capacity management PUE power consumption of each individual server aggregated data across multiple serversappliances complete data centres or even multiple data centres For the facility part itself the most significant savings are normally to be found in the cooling system Much of the cooling power can be reclaimed by eliminating cooling inefficiencies Thanks to The and its predictive character you can simulate power usage forecasting and the impact of temperature changes in efficiency allowing you to set up an automated cooling control system Increase the service level customer loyalty of the data centre The numbers tell the tale The better you measure the better you are informed and consequently take the most appropriate decisions Having the capability to measure power usage and power quality in the most accurate way from source down to the mouth individual power outlet or sensor and everything in between giving you the right tools at hand to provide correct billing information to their customers Plan capacity Enterprises have to meet their continuous growth objectives therefor rigorous and wellthought capacity planning and management is critical to any company allowing you to accommodate both the expected and unexpected needs of internal andor external customers business Thanks to the right and accurate metrics provided by The you can manage capacity planning for both contingencies and planned growth bringing significant cost and space saving Scalable The platform offers you a userfriendly interface where you can integrate virtually any single power consumer whether it is a Racktivity power measuring device or a third party device DCPM offers you a holistic full endtoend solution from the entering power supply down to the single power outlet The power in The lays in its flexibility The user itself defines how detailed he approaches the power environmental metrics offered to him via the software solution provides you the required and most accurate data
