Racktivity has developed a user friendly display (ACLD) to complete its new AC power monitoring link system (ACL). The ACL is typically used to monitor and meter AC power busbar systems on top off datacenter racks or in electrical cabinets.

The ACL system is composed of an ACL Master and AC Slaves which communicate over the Racktivity bus with each other. The ACLD can be put on the bus to visualize the metrics of the individual ACL Slaves. The primary purpose of the display device is to inform the occupants of a facility on the energy used per rack or per measured circuit breaker.

The ACLD display can be easily mounted in cabinet door panels. The display does not require any separate power source as the power is provided by the master on the RS485 bus. The number of ACL slaves to present on the display is fully customizable on the webGUI of the ACL master enabling the user to present own desired values on the display.

The display is equipped with 4 standard buttons to scroll through different slave modules and their respective power consumption values such as:



The display is equipped with 4 standard buttons to scroll through different slave modules and their respective power consumption values such as:

-   Current values per line (3ph + N)
-   Line Voltage of the slave devices (3ph + N)
-   Frequency per line (3ph + N)
-   Power factor per line (3ph + N)
-   Total harmonic Distortion per line (3ph + N)
-   Real Power per line (3ph)
-   Apparent power per line (3ph)
-   Total power of the selected ACLS device
-   Total Energy of the selected ACLS device
-   Dry contact state of the selected slave device
-   Internal temperature state of the slave devices
-   Device information (Firmware and UID)



Benefits
--------

-   On site power consumption overview of connected devices in the bus
-   No external power supply (power (24V) over R-BUS)
-   Easy to use
